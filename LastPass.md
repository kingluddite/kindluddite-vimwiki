# LastPass
* Family plan share passwords securely (Premium)
    + How do I use this?
    + Get m set up after testing a lot
* Don't give a password hint
* Enable Let LastPass fill your username and passwords for you
    - Settings: Turn LassPass on (this is when you create your lastpass account) and now you can autofill passwords through applications

## Manual enter a password
* Select Add Password
* Enter name
* Enter URL of site
* username (most of the time your email)
* Click generate password - make as long as possible 128 (if site supports that lenght)
  - Many sites do not support that length so you need to reduce the number
  - Best
    + Allow all character types
    + A-Z
    + a-z
    + 0-9
    + Special
* Check "Require Password Reprompt" Anytime someone copies a password out of LastPass (LP) you have to retype the LP master password
    - If you leave your phone, and someone gains access they can't copy your password without knowing your LP master password 
* AutoLogin checkbox (don't check as most of the time auto Login doesn't work)
* Save
* Now you have that app's password saved in your LP vault

* **Note** trying to set passwords directly from a site most of the time doesn't work right so best to 
  create password like above
