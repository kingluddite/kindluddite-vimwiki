## Stuff from slack
* now using Discord

Welcome to our Slack channel for our React cohort NAME HERE Looking forward to learning React with you!

week 1
@channel
Happy Wednesday everyone!
Hope the week is going well and you are enjoying the first week dive into JavaScript
Understanding OOP in JavaScript is challenging - this series is very helpful - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l3bTDlT6ZI&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i5yvDkJgt60vNVWffpblB7
Make sure you are investing two hours of coding every single day. I can not underestimate how important this time investment is to your success in this class and the entire Nucamp fullstack bootcamp.
Office hours: I am on Slack Mon-Friday from 5pm - 6pm. Please feel free to Slack me questions. Please cc me 
@Phil H
 but share it in our this slack channel and also in the 3-react slack channel (that channel has hundreds of students and dozens of instructors all taking and teaching the same React course you are taking) - Nucamp is a community were we learn and share learning together. Slack is a tremendous resource to finding solutions to questions when you are stuck. But remember before asking a question make sure you spend 20 minutes doing your due diligence on trying to solve the problem and when you ask a question be as articulate as you can and provide as much detail as necessary for others to help guide you to a solution - communication is key)
Happy coding :slightly_smiling_face:

Here are some additional resources I think are informative about confusing Javascript topics:
what is truthy falsy in JavaScript?

Great job today everyone! I told you it would be fun :slightly_smiling_face: (and informative)
Great teamwork in the breakout room. Great questions.
We have a great cohort this class.
Please remember to upload your workshop assigned by end of day tomorrow. I will grade and provide feedback on Monday.
Remember I'm offering a HOP (Hour Of Power) from 5pm - 6pm EST on Wednesday 4/6/2022. It is optional to attend but come join the party and bring any coding questions.

Happy Monday everyone!
I just graded and provided feedback to Workshop #1 assignments. If you did not upload yet, please do so now.
We had a lot of good code in this past workshop. Nice work everyone!
I encourage everyone to care about your code. Add instructional comments to help you explain what the code is doing. Employers love to see commented code (when they review your GitHub repos).
Format your code - spacing is important for two reasons 1) it makes your code cleaner 2) It make your code easier to read
here's how to format clean React code in VS code
Here is Wes Bos' advice (video) for setting up Prettier, VS Code, Eslint for working with Create React app
There are lots of opinions on how to do this but these are two good ones I recommend checking out to make the best decision that works for you.
Writing clean code is a skill that you will get better at with practice.
Please remember to code two hours every day.
Our first HOP (Hour of Power) is 5:00pm - 6:00pm EST on Wed 4/6/2022

Happy Saturday everyone!
Great workshop #2 today! I was really happy with the breakout room communication and teamwork.
Please remember to code two hours each day. Lots of information to digest in the next three weeks and if you stick to coding two hours each day it will help you make progress.
Please make sure to upload your completed Workshop #2 by end of day tomorrow. I will grade and provide feedback on Monday.
Have a great weekend! (edited)
