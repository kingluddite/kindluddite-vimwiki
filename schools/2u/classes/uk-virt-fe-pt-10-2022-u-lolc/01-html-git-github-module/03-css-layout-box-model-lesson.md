### Chrome Dev Tools
08-Stu-Project-Landing-Page/solved/index.html (teacher solution)

Open Chrome DevTools by pressing 
Command+Option+J (Mac) 
Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS)

Chrome DevTools has many useful features for debugging 
and even experimenting with the code in the browser

Navigate to the Styles tab on the Elements panel and note the CSS listed in the panel.

Point the cursor at a CSS property and click to uncheck the box. 
Note the style change on the webpage

Change the background-color property in the body to purple to further demonstrate how you can manually change a value.

Explain that changing CSS in the browser is a great way to experiment with style properties.

You can also check an element's accessibility by simply pointing the cursor at the image.
     Select the pointer icon and then point at an element on the page. 
        A box should indicate details about the element's accessibility, including the role that it should fulfill (like link, header, or image) to be properly read by an accessibility device
        If applicable, a contrast score will also be indicated.
Note that having enough contrast between colors helps ensure that your page is viewable to a range of users. 
Chrome DevTools is an easy way to check whether your page is readable.

Encourage students to experiment with Chrome DevTools as they build their own projects later in the class.
