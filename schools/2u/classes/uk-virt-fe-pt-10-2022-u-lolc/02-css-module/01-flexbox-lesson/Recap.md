# Recap
## Takeaways
* When setting display: flex to an HTML element, the flex items will automatically format as a row. Try using flex-direction to create a column using CSS Flexbox.
* Tell your class to try to apply box model properties (margin, padding, height, and width) to the flex children to see how the Flexible Box Module reacts.
* Remember that CSS Flexbox can only make one-dimensional layoutsâ€”layouts that are either a row or a column. Tell your students that, in the next class, we'll build complex two-dimensional layouts.
