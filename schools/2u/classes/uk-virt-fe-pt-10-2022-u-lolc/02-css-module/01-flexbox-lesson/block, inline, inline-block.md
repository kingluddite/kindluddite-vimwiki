# block, inline, inline-block
What’s the difference again?
let’s do a quick review https://www.samanthaming.com/pictorials/css-inline-vs-inlineblock-vs-block/

`inline`
* Displays an element as an inline element
* Any height and width properties will have no effect 
* inline elements appears on the same line

`inline-block`
* Displays an element as an inline-level block container 
* You can set height and width values

`block`
* starts on a NEW line and takes up the full width available 
* So that means block elements will occupy the entire width of its parent element
