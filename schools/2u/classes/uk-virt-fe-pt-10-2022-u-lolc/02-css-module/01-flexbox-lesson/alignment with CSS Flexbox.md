# Alignment with Flexbox
* this slide #23 to #36 move through

`Say:` "Being able to align content in CSS Flexbox is one of its most attractive features. Can anyone guess why?"
* `Answer`: It allows us to responsively position child elements inside their containers with only a few lines of code.

## Old way (oldschool)
* a few years ago aligning inside a flex container was awkward and an unresponsive experience
  * `Why?` Developers only tools to position elements vertically were margin and padding (or “hack” it into place using absolute positioning (NOT FUN!)

## Today it’s easier! 
* Because of two properties `align-items` and `justify-content` (next slide!)
