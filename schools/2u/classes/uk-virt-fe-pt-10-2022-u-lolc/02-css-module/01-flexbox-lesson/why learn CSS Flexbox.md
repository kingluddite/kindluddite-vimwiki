# Why learn CSS Flexbox?
* For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were floats and positioning 
* Modern layouts need a responsive design that modifies the content for each device state
* `Floats` and `positioning` work and were used but that caused some problems like: 
  * Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent 
  * Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available 
  * Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
