# Parsing FedEx Proves the Fed Canâ€™t Deliver a Soft Landing - Ep 841

the fed can't fight inflation if it doesn't fight harder

Even if we get a 100 basis point rate hike next week and the rate is moves up to 3.25%
Inflation is 8.25%

 3.25% - 8.25% = -5% real interest rates

Please answer this question: How can you fight inflation with -5% real rates?
I think it is impossible. If I am wrong please elaborate on this scenario and show me the error of my ways.

To kill inflation by raising interest rates the Fed has to change people's consumption and savings patterns.
But the fed wants to:
* Discourage People from spending, reduce demand and encourage people to save. If people save more, they have greater capital investment and that leads to more supply. That's how higher interest rates can both reduce demand and increase supply and that fights inflation.
But if interest rates are -5% you are not encouraging anyone to save money. The opposite happens, you are still punishing people to save because they are going to lose 5% of their savings every year through inflation. And because of this you are encouraging people to borrow more money and have their debts wiped out through inflation. This is why inflation is going to keep on getting worse as long as the federal reserve is still slow to hike rates. And they will get further behind the curve everytime they hike because they are too slow in hiking.

The question is not if the markets will wake up to this reality but the million dollar question is when are the markets going to wake up to this reality.

But the Fed's hike rates, even though they are not enough to kill inflation they are enough to kill the economy because we are in a massive bubble. Currently, our entire economy is based on low interest rates.

Nassim Taleb (wrote The Black Swan) - https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/15/the-fed-should-not-vary-interest-rates-from-normal-levels-says-author-nassim-taleb.html says we had 15 years of Disneyland that has basically destroyed the economic structure, 0% interest rates create bubbles or tumors like bitcoin, hedgefunds that should not exist but existed for 15 years of 0 interest rates. What is about to happen is not a black swan it's a white swan, it's easy to predict that 15 years of easy money will cause a tremendous amount of pain when you remove the punch bowl.

When money was free for 15 years how many misallocation of resources?
How many malinvestments?
How many bubbles were inflated?
How much did we overconsume?
How much did we underinvest?
How much excess debt was piled up?

Now the fed is taking away the support system that all that was built on. It all has to come crashing down like jenga - https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxzsOe8ujhcVnCw3s05tslkEXvx2tGi4r2

we are not transferring from a period of very low interest rates to a period of very high interest rates

 interest is the price you pay to borrow money but prices are determined by supply and demand when the fed is not artificially influencing it but eventually supply and demand will call the shots and the fed will prove impedent when supply and demand overwelms the fed - and we'll have a rate that actually reflects the balance between savings and borrowing in the economy

 if you have an economy with lots of savings and low borrowing, low interest rates work, becuase you have a lot of supply and lots of savings and not too much demand - not a lot of people want to borrow

that's not the US economy - no one wants to save and everyone wants to borrow - we have little supply and high demand so the price to borrow should be higher, and as a borrower if you have a lot of debt, you are a riskier borrower so you should be charged a higher premium by lenders - (the US governemnt is loaded up with $31 trillion dollars in debt and it didn't have any problems because it got away with extremely low interest rates but not for much longer) - please take a look at this chart (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A091RC1Q027SBEA) it shows we are paying right now $600 billion just in interest on our debt. Think about that for a minute. And if you see the increase in interest in 2021 you can see that before 2 years we will be paying $1 Trillion dollars a year just on interest and if interest rates rise that interest payment will grow exponentially. How long can this possibly go on for?

Let's look at the yield curve this week
yields rose across the board (more on the short end than long end)
The yield on 1 year treasury bill hit 4% (just for a moment) on Friday 9/16/2022. (it closed at 3.93%) A year ago a 1 year treasury bill (aka 12 month T bill rate) was .25% and now it is 400 basis points! What do you think happens when all these 1 year T bills mature on the Fed's balance sheet and then they have to pay 400 basis points instead of 25 basis points. That is a huge interest increase in just servicing the national debt.
If you look at the bond rates you will see we are inverted all the way from the 6 month all the way to the 10 year. The reason these yields are so low is only because everyone believes the fed can get rates back down to the holy grail of 2%.

So are bonds a good investment? Well the bond king himself Jeffrey Gundlach is saying he bonds are most attractive he's seen in 10 years - https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/15/jeffrey-gundlach-calls-bonds-the-most-attractive-hes-seen-in-10-years.html and he recommends people use bonds as a great investment relative to stocks because of their yields. CNBC this past week has been touting bonds because you can get yields of 3 - 4 %. But that's not a good deal. Bonds are a worse investment now than they were a year or two ago becuase yes, yields have gone up but their nominal yields, the real yields have gone down.

A yield on a 12 month T bill is 4%. But inflation is 8.25%. That's -4.25% real interest rates. When yields were 25 basis points (last year) everyone thought bonds were a good deal because inflation was supposedly 2% (a couple of years ago everyone believed inflation was only 2% because the CPI told them that) so back them you were only losing 125 basis points but now you're losing 425 basis points. People are losing more on bonds now then 2 years ago. So why is CNBC and the bond king so bullish on bonds? They are making a big bet that the Fed will win and get inflation back down to 2%. If that is true bonds are a way to make money. But what if as I believe the Fed will not succeed and lower inflation but instead surrender to inflation and inflation will rise, then bonds are a terrible investment. There currently bonds are riskier than stocks but certain stocks will go bankrupt. A lot of household names will go bankrupt and their shareholders will lose everything.
Look at FexEx. Peter says FedEx will be laying off 10% of workforce (I haven't found this 10% number or layoffs but let's assume peter knows something I don't) If they lay off 10% that's almost 25000 jobs! (.25 * 249,000). Why is FedEx down? Prices are so high people are buying less, and thus shipping less. The cost of shipping is going way up. Fuel costs are way higher. Their labor costs are higher and that is impacting profitability. But at the same time package volume is strinking and will continue to shrink because even though consumers are paying more they are not buying more because prices are going way up and people are spending more money but they are buying less stuff. The Fed and the Biden admin say 2 negative GDPs are not a recession but when mega blue chip companies like Walmart, FedEx, Target say we are in a recession, this duck is quacking like a recession. And as inflation grows and kills economic activity, there will be massive layoffs because companies in every recession lay off lot of people to cut costs. And as real spending goes down because we have a very high unemployment rate the fed will have to pivot from raising rates to lowering rates.

Jay Powell and the Fed honestly believe they can beat inflation but just putting the economy in a mild recession. The Fed doesn't believe a severe recession is in the cards. But what if they are wrong (as they were about "transitory" inflation - https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/el-erian-says-transitory-was-the-worst-inflation-call-in-the-history-of-the-fed.html - or how about in September 2019 when overnight money market rates spiked 10%! - https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.html) - this is just two times the Fed was wrong but they have been wrong many more times.
What if this isn't just a recession but a depression? What if this recession is worse than the 2008 recession? Will the Fed keep raising rates into a severe recession or depression?
Most people on CNBC and the Fed believe the recession will be brief and shallow. How can they think this?
The bust needs to be proportonate to the boom.
We've never had a boom this big.
We've never had interest rates this low for this long.
We've never had bigger asset, debt bubbles then we do now.
We've never had more misallocations to resources than we do now.
We have more mistakes that we need to fix than ever before. How can we possibly fix all of the above with a short and shallow recession. It's impossible. This will not be a soft landing (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-06/soft-landing-is-possible-for-us-yet-still-a-hard-bet-to-place). This will be a hard landing. This will be a massive recession and the Fed will reverse course because they don't have the stomach for the riots, the civil unrest that comes with the greatest depression ever.
So if you think Jay Powell will act like Volker and you are investing with your thoughts, you will lose on that bet.
So if I'm right and the fed pivots this pivot will not be like the pivot from 2020 (remember this emergency move by the fed -https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-to-zero-and-launches-massive-700-billion-quantitative-easing-program.html - the fed acts like it is helping the world but it really is a short term solution that in the long term destroys the purchasing power of everyone and leads us to where we are now)
But this pivot will be different than most investors expect
This time the fed is pivoting when inflation is well above 2%, (it will be well above 4% or 6% or wherever it is when the fed pivots)
