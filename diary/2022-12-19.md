Today I made some progress with colemak dh thanks to this site

https://www.colemak.academy/
I had to turn key mapping off and it let me work on the homerow of colemak dh -
so there is a dhm and dh and not sure what the difference is 
I practice for about 25 minutes
I adjusted my monitors higher and started to test the new moonlander keyboard
and adjust it slightly for comfort, where is my mouse? where is my coffee? not
sure just trying it out
I am about 9 wps (best score today) - https://i.imgur.com/7EdIugg.png
I need to organize my stuff so it is not messy - should have my keyboard easily accessible

## diet
I am now going to print out large font my menu for vegan meals so mom can easily
see it and I can to make healthy meals

## great resource for vimwiki
