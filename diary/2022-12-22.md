# Learning colemak
Spend a half hour working on colemak academy
I found out that I was using colemak dhm not dhk, from what I read dhm is
superior with ergo in mind and that's my top priority
I finally got 20 wpm on level 1 and jumped to level 2 which is just adding the g
(right of T) and m (left of n) - not a big change but my best was 16 wpm

I'm starting to think of non character keys and how they will fit in with my
workflow like when I use tmux with `ctrl-a + s` 

## I also am going through a tutorial to set up nvim via lua by a popular coder
on you tube

## not sure why my markdown spacing in this file is acting wack

## changing a nvim is just a matter of renaming nvim in .config folder (I saved
my old one and I'm experimenting with new one to see if I learn any cool new
tips or techniques
