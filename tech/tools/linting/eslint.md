#Eslint

## For react
* If you don't nest your input inside your label for a form you get an error
`Form label must have associated control when there is an htmlFor`
* TODO Airbnb wants you to nest the `input` inside the `label` I tried to fix it but failed miserably 

## Don't give errors for prop-types 
`"react/prop-types": "off",`
