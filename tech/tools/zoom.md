## Zoom Settings
* In web client - Turn on:
  * **note** There is a difference between cloud and desktop (the cloud settings have far more options)
  * Sound notifications when someone joins or leaves
  * Make sure to turn off "Automatic Recording" - If you don't as soon as you start your meeting you are recording and you end up having to turn it off
