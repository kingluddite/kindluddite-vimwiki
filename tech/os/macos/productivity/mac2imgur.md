* This app enables me to take a screenshot `<cmd-shift-4>` and it will upload the image to <a href="https://imgur.com/" target="_blank">imgur</a> (you need to create an account and log in)
* If you are taking a screenshot of sensitive information and you don't want to upload it to imgur use the following setting to ask you before  uploading and you can say do not upload

## Troubleshooting
* At times when it doesn't work just close the app, log out of imgur, open the app and re-login to imgur and it should work again
