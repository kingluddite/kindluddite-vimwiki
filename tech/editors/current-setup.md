# Nvim Current Setup
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8&t=2493s
* I used his terminal setup (ohmyzsh)
* I used his tmux setup (blended what I had)
* he had some fixes

## Corrections
Corrections:
1:08:26 - Do this for autotags instead: "use({ "windwp/nvim-ts-autotag", after = "nvim-treesitter" }) "

## Requirements
* iterm (I use kitty instead)
* neovim 0.8.0
* ripgrep - for telescope fuzzy finder `$ brew install neovim`

## Problems
* was using chris@machine nvim from scratch but when I updated all homebrew it updated nvim from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0 and my nvim setup broke so that's why I upgraded to this nvim setup
