# vim-surround
* Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more. The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add such surroundings in pairs.

| key binding | action                  | note |
|-------------|-------------------------|------|
| `ds{`      | delete surrounding `{}` |      |
| `cs"`      | delete surrounding `{}` |      |
