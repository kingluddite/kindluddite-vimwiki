# vim-surround
* Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more. The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add such surroundings in pairs.

| key binding | action                  | note |
|-------------|-------------------------|------|
| `ds{`       | delete surrounding `{}` |      |
| `ysiw{`     | add `{}` around word    |      |

* **TIP** Below helps me understand vim surround:

`cs"' or cs'" -> change surroundings <from> - <to>`
