# Better Escape
A lot of people have been mapping jk or kj or kk to ESC in order to escape insert mode quickly. However, when we press the first key in these mappings, Vim/Nvim will wait for timeoutlen milliseconds before writing this char to buffer. The apparent lag caused by this behaviour is annoying.

Better-escape.vim is created to help Vim/Nvim users escape insert mode quickly using their customized key combinations, without experiencing the lag.
