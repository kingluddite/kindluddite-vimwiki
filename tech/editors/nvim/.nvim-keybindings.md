# Nvim Keybindings
* To understand what my key notation means below first [my key translation](./my-key-translation.md)

## Remap the Caps Lock Key
* **my preference** I remapped it to the left control key on my mac using using <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" target="_blank">Karabiner-Elements</a>
* You don't need the caps lock and the caps lock on a keyboard is placed in prime real estate
* A lot of Vim developers remap it to the `<ESC>` key

## Insert Mode Key Bindings
[See Insert Mode](./modes/insert.md)

| binding | action                                                    | notes |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `A`     | Go to end of line and switch to insert mode               |       |
| `ga`    | hover over letter and type `ga` to get symbol code number |       |
| `<C-o>` | jump back to prefious jump                                |       |
| `<C-i>` | jump forward to prefious jump                             |       |
| `:%d`   | select and delete all lines                               |       |
| `:%y`   | select and copy all lines                                 |       |


## How to find key mappings
* `:nmap` for normal mode mappings
* `:vmap` for visual mode mappings
* `:imap` for insert mode mappings
* `help <KEY>` Will pen help for all standard keys but not for your custom commands
* `:verbose map <C-u>` You can find out where `<C-u>` was mapped (this is great because when a vim default doesn't work as you expect, you overwrote it or a plugin overwrote it and this help you find what happened)
* `:verb map <C-u>` - Shortcut for writing above line

## Repeatable Actions and how to Reverse them 
| Intent                           | Act                   | Repeat | Reverse |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------|---------|
| Make a change                    | {edit}                | `.`    | `u`     |
| Scan line for next char          | f{char}/t{char}       | `;`    | `,`     |
| Scan line for prev char          | F{char}/T{char}       | `;`    | `,`     |
| Scan document for next match     | /pattern<CR>          | `n`    | `N`     |
| Scan document for previous match | ?pattern<CR>          | `n`    | `N`     |
| Perform substitution             | :s/target/replacement | `&`    | `u`     |
| Execute a sequence of changes    | qx{changes}q          | `@x`   | `u`     |

## Searching
| key binding      | action                                                                        | notes |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `:noh`           | Turn off highlighting until next search                                       |       |
| `vg_`            | visual select to the end of the line excluding any whitespace and the newline |       |
| `:grep`+ PATTERN | searches all files in your project                                            |       |
| `*`              | executes a search for the word under the cursor at that moment                |       |

### Splitting Screens horizontally and vertically
| binding          | action                                                 | notes |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `<ctrl+w>` + `v` | open window NEXT to existing window                    | na    |
| `<ctrl+w>` + `s` | open window at bottom of the currently selected window | na    |

## Navigate Screens
* These are the "Home Keys"
| binding       | action                                  | notes |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| `<C-w>` + `l` | Move to RIGHT window of selected window |       |
| `<C-w>` + `h` | Move to LEFT window of selected window  |       |
| `<C-w>` + `j` | Move to window BELOW selected window    |       |
| `<C-w>` + `k` | Move to window ABOVE selected window    |       |

### tips of l, h, j and k keys
* lowercase "L" key, (`;` is to the right of `l`)
* `h` is left of `j`
* `j` is an [descender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender) so movement is down
* `k` is an [ascendor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography)) so movement is up

### Editing - Two for the price of one

|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `C` or `C$`    | delete the current line and switch to insert mode |                     |
| `s` or `cl`    | ??? TODO my vim is has different setting          |                     |
| `S` or `^C`    | ??? TODO my vim is has different setting          |                     |

## Custom Key Mappings
| keyboard binding | action                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `jk`             | switch to command mode (custom map) |
| `zz`             | save file                           |

* Set up in your mappings config file
* These are just my personal preferences
* [better escape](../nvim/plugins/better-escape.md) plugin makes this using `jk` better

## Easy Caps
* Easy to make any work all capital letters

1. Add this to your mappings

```
" Easy CAPS
inoremap <c-u> <ESC>viwUi
nnoremap <c-u> viwU<Esc>
```

1. Place cursor over any word and `<ctrl-u>`
