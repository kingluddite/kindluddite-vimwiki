# Marks
* There are global marks and local marks

## What are global marks?
* A global mark is a kind of bookmark that allows us to jump between files
* You can mark your nvim with `mV` then anytime snap back to it with `V
* **note** global marks are persisted between editing sessions (configurable behavior `:h 'viminfo'`)
* This is great because you just need two keystrokes to open up files you always use
* You can use up to (probably never need this many) 26 global marks
