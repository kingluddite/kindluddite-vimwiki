# Insert Mode
* `zt`, `zz`, `zb` leaves the cursor in the current screen
* **note** I was having issues with my Sneak plugin with the `z.` command
* note I use `zz` to save so that command does not work
* **note** I was having issues until I set my `scrolloff=5` in my `.vimrc` (I did not set it to `scrolloff=0` to give me a little legroom)

## What are digigraphs?
* Pairs of characters that are easy to remember

## Man Pages: scroll-cursor
* You can get all this info using `help scroll-cursor`

## Insert Normal Mode
* Special mode that lets us fire off one single command then return us to normal mode
* So `<C-o>zz` should take you into Normal mode, you fire `z.` to take you to the middle of your page and then you are right back into Insert mode
  * **note** I overwrote Insert Normal Mode with `<C-o>` which opens up my NerdTree sidebar
