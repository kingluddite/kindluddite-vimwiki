# Vim
* Vim is just a text editor

## Why use Vim?
1. Efficiency
  - Vim's belief is most people spend more time editing existing text then writing new text
    + This is true for developers who spend more time refactoring code than typing new code
  - Vim tries to force you to only use the keyboard (and wants you to say goodbye to your mouse)
    + It makes you do stuff fast by giving you the ability to use default keyboard shortcuts
    + And it gives you the ability to create new keyboard shortcuts
    + Both of the above are to make you able to complete repitive tasks quickly
  - Using `Vim` properly gives you to `Code at the speed of thought`
2. Ubiquity
  - `Vim` is available everywhere. `VS Code` is cool but you can only use it if someone installs in on the machine your using. You don't need to install `Vim` it's on every machine already and it's on every major platform already as well
    + Do you SSH into terminal sessions a lot? Imagine if you could use Vim in every terminal session. You can, and you don't need to install it, it's already there

## What is a fast way to learn `Vim`?
`$ vimtutor`

* Then follow the instructions and you will up and running in no time at all

## .vimrc
* This is a simple text file that (the vim configuration file) that `Vim` processes each time it is loaded
* You will put all your keyboard shortcuts and other custom configuration that will make Vim unique to how you use it

## nvim
* **note** I moved from `Vim` to [Nvim](./nvim.md) as it is a fork of `Vim` but better maintained and has a large accessible community
